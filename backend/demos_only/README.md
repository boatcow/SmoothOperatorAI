# Price Negotiator

## Introduction

Welcome to the Price Negotiator! 

This is a project that uses LangChain to negotiate the price of a product or service offerings from an external vendor / contractor.

The jupyter notebook is the main file to run the demo, and should be self-contained. The other files are just copies of the cell blocks from the notebook.
